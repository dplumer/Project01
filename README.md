David Plumer- Web Development Project 1 (Business or Personal site)

Overview:
   This project is designed to practice several basic HTML, CSS, and JS techniques and familiarize myself with the fundamentals of 
coding for web design. The overall goal is a simple one: to create a personal website focused on things about myself using each separate HTML page to 
focus on a different interest I have. The three interests will be movies, boardgames, and music. There won't be any effort into making the site comprehensive
as I think it will be more important to practice several different outline structures to help broaden my overall skill level. To that end I will create several different display types for the information: a carousel, a grid, and a numbered list. 

Use:
    Personal information website. The user is initially linked to a low clutter introduction page with an image and/or short biography. The navbar at the top of the
page will lead users to the individual interest HTML sites that will be uniform in outlook. Each page will display the information in a different way but contain a largely identical navbar for convenience of navigation. The tabs will use common iconography to make navigation easier for non-english speakers. 

Future improvement:

1. A parallax and dynamic background image to give motion and aesthetic appeal to the overall look of the site. (I tried this several times but couldn't find a way to keep the parallax image from pushing all of the page content down and out of sight on initial view)
2. More content. There should be detailed reviews of all of the albums and boardgames to give users a more thorough understanding of why these items were chosen. 
3. Clean up the CSS. I've noticed that I have a tendency to accumulate code even when it is no longer in use. I need to make a conscious effort to make sure to remove unneeded code and make sure that all the pages are legible.
