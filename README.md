David Plumer- Web Development Project 1 (Business or Personal site)

Overview:
   This project is designed to practice several basic HTML, CSS, and JS techniques and familiarize myself with the fundamentals of 
coding for web design. The overall goal is a simple one: to create a personal website focused on things about myself using each separate HTML page to 
focus on a different interest I have. The three interests will be movies, boardgames, and music. There won't be any effort into making the site comprehensive
as I think it will be more important to practice several different outline structures to help broaden my overall skill level. To that end I will create several different display types for the information: a carousel, a grid, and a numbered list.
