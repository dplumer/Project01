  <p>I have always had a strong affinity for movies. My top 100 has been a topic of much internal debate over the past few years, and it seems no stretch of the imagination that I would include a choice selection here. So, without further adieu and in no particular order, here are my current favorite movies. 
  <ul>
    <li><h1><b>The Last of the Mohicans</b><em> Directed by Michael Mann </h1></em>

      <p>Michael Mann's 1992 romance,  <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0104691/">
      The Last of the Mohicans 
      </a>,while not strictly faithful to the plot and characterization of the novel from which it derives its name, is certainly reflective of the gradeur and power of James Fenimore Cooper's timeless adventure. Wes Studi turns in one of the most criminally underappreciated film villain performances of all time, and the sweeping strains of Trevor Jones and Randy Edelman's soundtrack fit perfectly with the sprawling vistas and unforgettable imagery. </p>
    </li>
    <li><h1>Superman: The Movie<em>Directed by Richard Donner</em></h1>
      <img src="https://i.postimg.cc/DyRvG0R0/superman-the-movie-movie-poster.jpg" width="450" height="800" class="center">
      <p>There are a million and one reasons why Richard Donner's modern mythical classic <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0104691/"> Superman: The Movie 
        </a> should never have worked,but it does. From the iconic and genre defining performance of Christopher Reeve as the Last Son of Krypton to the tireless efforts of an endlessly talented ensemble of characters that completely sell the usurped New York City skyline as the almost equally iconic Metropolis. Margot Kidder commands every scene as the jaded hard-nosed reporter that sees the incorruptable goodness of the Man of Steel writ large before her and successfully brings the cynical hearts of the movie's world-weary audience back to a place where we really could believe a man could fly.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
     <h1>The Searchers<em>Directed by John Ford</em></h1>
      <img src="https://i.postimg.cc/XYLwbhTb/Searchers-movie-poster.jpg" id="poster" class="center" width="450" height="800"/>
    <p>There is very little that hasn't been said in praise of John Ford's timeless and powerful look back at the height of the American west. His 1956 classic <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0049730/?ref_=fn_al_tt_1">
        The Searchers 
      </a> shows the dangerously beautiful landscapes, caught magnificently in the grand scale that only the golden age of Hollywood seemed to be able to capture. John Wayne turns in his darkest and most layered performance showcasing an oft overlooked wealth of talent that so frequently gets forgotten behind the titanic personality of the actor.
